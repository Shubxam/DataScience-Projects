# DataScience-Projects
Jupyter notebooks of the various data science projects I've undertaken.

## Kaggle DS Exploration
In 2017, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) (a data science community and competition platform) conducted a survey on a large range of users registered as the data scientist in their platform. The survey data are broadly covered the skill set of the data scientists, the demographic of the data scientists, the feedback of the platform and many other information. 

In this task, you will need to 

- **Part 1**: Given the following two data sets, you are required to finish some required analysis, with the exploreation data analytics skills as well as visuilization skills
     - [MCQResponses.csv](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742/raw/master/Assessment/2020/data/MCQResponses.csv): Participants' answers to multiple choice questions. Each column contains the answers of one respondent to a specific question.     
     - [ConversionRates.csv](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742/raw/master/Assessment/2020/data/ConversionRates.csv): Currency conversion rates to USD. 
- **Part 2**: Given the following data set, you are required to find out top keywords for hiring the data scientists. 
    - [JobPostings.csv](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742/raw/master/Assessment/2020/data/JobPostings.csv): Data scientists job advertising in US with job descriptions, from JobPikr.


You will be required to complete the coding to answer the questions with a neat and clean format, and your commenting and adherence to code standards will also be considered when marking. Further information on Python standards, please visit https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ 
## Wales Employment Data
This assignment will use â€‹employment data of Wales from the StatsWales data source. This dataset provides workplace employment estimates, or estimates of total jobs, for Wales and its NUTS2 areas, along with comparable UK data disaggregated by industry section.
